Phaser - Hello World
====================

Working with the Phaser game library for JavaScript / HTML 5 gaming.

Also, setting up an environment on my Linux VM, so I can resume coding in my
local dev setup.  Much more comfortable.

==========

General cleanup. Moving some things around.  Building some basic example-type
tools to help introduce myself.

- Pulling phaser-tower-defense example code up to root level
- Creating a new directory to contain my-tower-defense code
- Pulling README up to parent directory.
- Creating new project directory for basic movement example tool.
